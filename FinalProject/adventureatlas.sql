I\'ve never been to Bled, but it\'s definitely on my bucket list now. The walk around the lake sounds amazing, and I can\'t wait to capture those picture-perfect views from the Ojstrica viewpoint.

It covers all the must-visit attractions and the tips on dressing conservatively are helpful, especially for female travelers.

The inclusion of Gueliz as a break from the traditional Medina is a great suggestion.

I’m pretty confident that by the end of this blog post, you will feel the same. The outdoor adventure, nature, and landscapes in Argentina are second to none and in this travel blog post, I am going to share with you the best things to do in Argentina when it comes to outdoor adventure. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeing the eighth-largest country in the world, there is a lot of ground to cover on a trip to Argentina but it really does have something for everyone. From the metropolitan capital city of Buenos Aires to the hiking towns surrounded by towering mountains, the incredible marine wildlife found on the east coast, and of course the wine region of Mendoza, the adventures are endless.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre you ready? I’m not sure you are…', 'The best time to visit Argentina is in the late spring and summer months, between the end of October and the end of March, when you can enjoy the whole country thanks to the favorable weather conditions. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDecember to February is peak season and all the main tourist destinations will be busy. You will have to make reservations for buses, internal flights, and accommodations well in advance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSummer is the best time to visit Argentina if you want to admire wildlife in the areas of Peninsula Valdes and Punta Tombo (though whales and orcas are spotted during the winter months). Patagonia is best visited in the summer, when Perito Moreno is not prohibitively cold; the same can be said for Tierra del Fuego.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuenos Aires gets tremendously hot in the summer months, but it’s very pleasant in September and October, when all the large boulevards are colorful with jacaranda trees in full bloom.\r\n\r\n', 'Hike Laguna de Los Tres to the base of Fitz Roy, El Chalten', 'Fitz Roy is set among the Andes mountain range and reaches an incredible 3405 meters! Its recognizable silhouette draws mountain lovers here to complete the 26km trail (you may also know it as the logo for hiking brand Patagonia!) and I promise you won’t regret it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpend a few days in the sleepy town of El Chalten to ensure you get the best weather for your trek, the summer season runs from October until April and the fewer clouds the better! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nInstead of following the main out-and-back trail, take a shuttle or taxi 14km north of El Chalten to Hosteria El Pilar, from here you walk through a beautiful forest, out into the valley, passing glaciers before heading up the (very tough) final 2 km to Laguna de Los Torres. Honestly, whilst hiking this part of the trail I really began to wonder if it was worth it. The views say it all.', 'Explore San Carlos de Bariloche, the gateway to Patagonia', 'Known for its Swiss-style architecture and numerous craft chocolate shops (Mamuschka is a must), you cannot miss this beautiful town. Nestled amongst the Andes mountains, there are world-class ski and snowboarding resorts at Catedral Alta Patagonia for the winter months (July – September). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for the summer, the chairlifts here actually run all year round so take it up to the top of Cerro Catedral for staggering views of Lake Nahuel Huapi, or make your way to Llao Llao National Park for several hiking trails. Oh and don’t forget to check out the local craft beer!', 'Explore Buenos Aires', 'This city really is a mix of European influence and Latin American culture, it is cool, sophisticated, and vibrant. The twist of both modern and traditionalism within its neighborhoods make the entire city a delight to explore. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHead to San Telmo for history, cobbled streets, and flea markets. Next, La Boca for brightly colored houses and the home of the famous football team, La Boca Juniors, catch a match if you can. Spend time in Palermo, the largest barrio, enjoying the landscaped gardens, museums, and hip bars and cafes. Finally, make your way to Retiro to enjoy a romantic dinner and a tango show in the docklands.', 'Visit Iguazu Falls', 'This jaw-dropping waterfall system makes for the largest waterfall in the world, and as a result, it borders both Argentina and Brazil. Formed by a volcanic eruption there are a staggering 275 waterfalls, reaching almost 3km wide! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are several different circuits to complete via the walkway system designed to help you get the best views of these magical falls. Complete the ‘upper circuit’ first thing or late afternoon to catch rainbows above the falls. Do not miss Devil’s Throat either, you will hear it before you see it!

Forget the outdated notions of this place as a gritty crime haven. These days, Bogotá is a safe and forward-thinking city that is trending with global adventurers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a rich history and a promising future, Bogotá is a fascinating place to be right now. And it’s so much bigger than you think! With a metro population of nearly ten million people, the city dwarfs most American and European cities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you’ve only got 48 hours to explore Bogotá, you’ll want to start with the top spots and try to pack as much as you can into each day. Here are a few things you absolutely must-see.', 'Getting to Town: El Dorado Airport is about nine miles west of the city center. You can grab an official airport taxi (yellow and white) for the quickest ride into town– taking around 20 minutes and costing approximately 15,000 Colombian pesos. I highly recommend using UBER or your hotel transfers for transportation around the city.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLanguage: The official language of Colombia is Spanish.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrency: 1 Colombian Peso equals 0,00021 EUR, so you’re looking at around 4695 pesos to a euro.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClimate: March is the hottest month in Bogota with an average temperature of around 21ºC, and the coldest is December at 12ºC. It typically has dry warm summers and mild winters.', 'The Artisan Markets', 'Come ready to haggle! There are great markets all over Bogotá, and they are the best places to get a souvenir.

Plan on at least a couple of hours to wander around and see all of the vendors.', 'Monserrate', 'No matter where you are in the city, you can see the iconic Monserrate Mountain. A Colombian spiritual and cultural symbol, this must-see attraction is something you’ll want to spend the morning taking in. Ride the funicular or the cable car up the mountain for a panoramic view of Bogotá and beyond.', 'Night Out in Chia at Andres Carne de Res', 'If you’re in Bogotá on a Friday or Saturday night, you’re in luck!

(5, 25, 'A 3-Day Lisbon Itinerary | Portugal', 'Europe', '', 'If you´re looking for a beautiful and affordable European destination to explore, look no further than Lisbon, the capital of Portugal. Lisbon is one of my absolute favorite cities in Europe, and I´ve put together a 3-day itinerary so you can enjoy the best of Lisbon on a weekend getaway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLisbon is a vibrant and picturesque city, with plenty of sights to explore and delicious food to enjoy. So, if you´re looking for things to do in Lisbon, keep on reading!\r\n\r\n', 'As a city with very mild weather and overall good weather, Lisbon is a city you can honestly visit all year round! Whether looking for a summer city escape or an autumn weekend getaway, Lisbon will welcome you with open (and often sunny) arms. My favorite time to visit is in late spring/early summer, from May-June, or late summer/early autumn (September-October), as you avoid the summer crowds and experience Lisbon like a local.', 'Day 1', 'On the first day of this Lisbon itinerary, get your comfortable shoes on and explore one or two neighborhoods. If you´re an early bird, I recommend heading to Miradouro Portas do Sol.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Miradouro is a viewpoint, and there are many dotted across the city, but this one is the postcard-perfect view over the city. Make sure to go just as the sun rises for a beautiful sight of Lisbon´s terracotta rooftops. It´s also great to check this off when it isn´t tourist central, and it´s easy to grab the perfect shot! Make the most of the morning to explore Castelo de São Jorge, a Moorish castle with incredible views of Lisbon. It´s a great way to get your bearings and take in some of the city´s history. The entrance fee is only 8.50€.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter exploring the castle and its grounds, head up to Miradoura da Graça. It´s quite a steep climb, but worth the calf workout as the views from this Miradouro are one of my favorites! Next, walk back down towards Portas del Sol, but take a right down Rua de São Tomé until you hit the narrow streets of Alfama.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo Lisbon itinerary would be complete without a visit to Alfama. Alfama is Lisbon´s oldest neighborhood. This area is famous for its narrow cobblestone streets, colorful buildings, and hidden squares. As you wander around, you´ll find many cute traditional cafes serving up delicious custard tarts and pastel de nata (Portuguese egg tart). Stop off at one or two along the way!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce you´ve had your fill of Alfama, hop on the 28E tram and take it all the way to Praça do Comércio. This is the “tourist center” of Lisbon as it´s where the main square is and the streets are filled with restaurants, and mainstream shops like Zara, Bershka, Mango, etc. The views and architecture surrounding the main square are beautiful to stroll around, but as I said, it is tourist central.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you´re a sunset and seafood lover, maybe cut the shopping short or skip it altogether and take the ferry over the river for dinner. The ferry you need to get on is the one to Cacilhas at Cais do Sodre station. The ferry costs 1.30€ each way. Tickets need to be bought in the ticket machines at the station.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe other side of Ponte 25 de Abril, in Cacilhas, has a row of seafood restaurants offering incredible sunset views. One of the most popular ones, and the one I ate at, is Ponto Final. Ponto Final is known for its seafood platters, but they also have 2 vegan/veggie options, so it caters to all! It´s a simple, rustic restaurant with just plastic chairs and tables, but that´s part of its charm. And the people that flock there to queue for a special dinner is a testament to it.', 'Day 2', 'Start day two with a nice little walk around Principe Real as it has so many of the classic, colorful tiled buildings. There´s also another viewpoint, Miradouro de São Pedro da Alcantara, from which you get impressive views of the city.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a slow morning in Principe Real, hop on a bus or an Uber to make your way down to LX Factory. This former industrial area has been re-invented as a creative hub for local Portuguese creatives to sell their products. It´s very hipster and is full of boutique cafes, cool bars, and shops where you can find vintage furniture, jewelry, and clothes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon´t just stay in the main little street of LX Factory; walk through the stores and the building behind, known as Edificio I Building, as that´s where things get interesting! There are honestly so many floors (I never made up all of them) and so many different things going on in these rented spaces that it´s quite fascinating to people-watch and get lost in this grungy building.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLX Factory is also home to Livraria Ler Devagar, one of the most beautiful bookstores I´ve ever seen. This bookstore spans three floors and is filled to the brim with books, posters, and art installations!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe next part of this itinerary is probably my favorite part of this Lisbon itinerary: getting on an electric scooter to ride along the river in Santa Maria de Belém! There are countless bikes right outside LX Factory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nScoot down to the MAAT. This museum is right on the banks of the River Tagus, and it´s an absolutely stunning architectural building. If you´re not in a rush, park your scooter at the entrance and spend some time wandering around the gallery.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPick your scooter back up and ride along the riverside towards Belém Tower. This iconic tower is a UNESCO World Heritage site that has existed since the 16th century. Entry to Belém Tower only costs 6€, and well worth it for a one-of-a-kind experience!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlternatively, make your way back to the MAAT and watch the sun go down from its rooftop (the only time the sun sets over the ocean on the far right side is in winter, from November to March). The view here is equally sensational, and in summer, it´s absolutely buzzing with people sitting on the steps and having an early evening stroll.', 'Day 3', 'Make no mistake, taking a one-day trip to Sintra from Lisbon should be included in any proper Portugal itinerary. Nestled in the scenic central mountains of Portugal, Sintra is unlike any other town I´ve visited. Taking a day trip to Sintra is like visiting a theme park for architecture lovers. The city is impossible to forget.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLuckily, a Sintra day trip from Lisbon, Portugal couldn´t be easier. All it requires is a comfortable 45-minute train ride from Rossio train station in Lisbon. The best part? Round trip tickets cost 5€ per person.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf all the places to visit in Sintra, Pena Palace is the most popular. And that´s why I recommend you arrive 15 minutes before the 9:30 am opening time. If you´re coming from the train station, you´ll definitely want to take a taxi up here. Otherwise, it´s a 45-minute uphill walk, and that´s not the best way to start your day in Sintra!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhotos cannot do Pena Palace justice. The whole experience of exploring the grounds, turrets, and balconies was wondrous and a bit surreal. Given its vibrant primary color palette, you´d be surprised to learn that it started out as a monastery in the Middle Ages. In the 1800s, King Fernando greatly expanded the existing structure into a summer palace for the royal family. When the Portuguese monarchy was deposed in 1910, the site became a national monument and museum.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter exploring the palace, make your way to Moorish Castle, originally constructed in the 8th century, but rebuilt several times (which is why you can still walk the walls without them crumbling beneath your feet).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNext, it´s time to get back down to Sintra town. You have four choices: bus, Tuk Tuk, Uber, or walking. I personally recommend hiking the beautiful path that links the Moorish Castle to the city center as you will pass several viewpoints and Villa Sassetti´s gardens. Also, it is a good way to get away from the over-crowdedness and into the quiet nature.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArriving at the center of Sintra´s old town after a walk in nature can feel a little busy and too touristy, but it´s not as bad as it could be. Take a stroll along the pedestrianized streets and narrow stairways admiring the cute shops, churches, and townhouses, and chances are you´ll be won over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter you´ve taken in the old town and energized yourself with some calories, head towards Quinta da Regaleira and spend your afternoon strolling around the majestic gardens.', '', '', '2023-06-01 16:01:03', 1),

Below, I cover the best things to do in Iceland, including visiting Vik’s black sand beach, glaciers, the blue lagoon, and more in this self-drive ultimate itinerary of 4 days in Iceland!\r\n', 'Before getting into this 4 day in Iceland itinerary, I want to cover a couple of common questions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first thing everyone asks us about Iceland is if it’s an expensive destination. It’s true, Iceland is extremely expensive! We found great flight prices, but once you land, your gas, food, and even your stay will cost a pretty penny.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd When it´s the best time to Visit? Iceland is very unique at all times of the year, so there is really no bad time. It mainly depends on what you wish to experience in Iceland.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWinter in Iceland can be the most brutal, but if you are planning on seeing the Northern Lights, this is the best and only time to visit Iceland.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSometimes you can see the Northern lights in the fall in Iceland, but the chances are rare. If you are trying to escape the cold, try towards the end of October or early November.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring Spring in Iceland, you can start to enjoy longer days and flower blooms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSummer is probably one of the most popular times to visit Iceland, so booking accommodations in advance is important. During the months of July and August, you can experience the midnight sun, making Iceland´s summer very unique. This is when the sun doesn’t actually set, so it’s 24 hrs of daylight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDepending on the time of year you visit, it might be required to have chains on the tires and a 4-wheel drive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDepending on the time of year, you might have the chance to see the Northern Lights! The best time to see the aurora in Iceland is from November to the end of March.', 'Day 1 of 4 Days in Iceland: The Blue Lagoon and Iceland Tour', 'With 4 days in your Iceland itinerary, The Blue Lagoon is easily a must-do Iceland attraction! I mean, did you even visit Iceland without seeing the turquoise water of this geothermal feature?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe best time to visit the Blue Lagoon is upon arrival or departure since it is right next to the international airport (not to be confused with the Blue Lagoon Spa in Reykjavik)!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe tickets now range depending on how many tickets are available for each time slot. I found they are ranging between $50 – $100 USD each for the basic (comfort) package, which I believe was more than enough. It included your towel, a free silica mask, and a free drink.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, is the Blue Lagoon worth all the hype? I think so! It was pouring rain, and extremely windy the day we went, so we weren’t expecting much.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe tickets were nonrefundable, so we said, “let’s just jump in and jump out of the lagoon quick,” just to say we did it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo our surprise, once we were inside the water, it was magical.

Seeing the Jokulsarlon Glacier was an incredible experience and the first glacier I’ve ever witnessed!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy favorite thing about visiting was hearing the ice all cling together as the water swished back and forth. As you make your way to Diamond Beach across the street, you will see pieces of the glacier scattered along the beach, literally glistening like diamonds!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is also one of the most beautiful black sand beaches in Iceland.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom Selfoss, where we stayed, it is about 4 hours away. Reykjavik is approximately 5 hours away, so you will want to start early!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis road trip will take the full day and includes some awesome stops along the way. While driving, you will pass epic waterfalls such as Seljalandsfoss Waterfall (the waterfall you can walk behind) and Skogafoss Waterfall. If you have the time, you can even hike to the abandoned Solheimasandur plane crash.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI also suggest driving through the town of Vik and visiting the Reynisfjara black sand beach and basalt columns! During the summer, you can even see puffins on Vik’s beach!', 'Day 3 of 4 Days in Iceland: Self-drive the Golden Circle', 'The Golden Circle drive is another bucket list-worthy thing to do in Iceland.

As one of the best places to visit in Morocco, Marrakech is high on many travellers’ bucket lists and with reason! There are so many things to do in Morocco that it can be hard to know where to start. This 3-day itinerary for Marrakech will help you make the most of your time in Marrakech and see the best that the city has to offer. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMarrakech is the capital city of Morocco. The city has a rich history and culture and is a popular tourist destination. As one of the best places to visit in Morocco, there are many things to see and do in Marrakech including exploring the ancient Medina, visiting the beautiful Majorelle Gardens, bargaining for souvenirs in the markets, and even visiting a giant cactus farm!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven though Marrakech is a relatively small city and most places to visit aren’t far apart so you can get a lot done in a short space of time without it feeling rushed, but only if you plan your days ahead. This is where this blog post comes in! In this blog post, you will find a detailed 3-day itinerary that will take you through the top things to do in Marrakech so you can make the most of your time during your visit.', 'Packing for a trip to a predominantly Islamic city is often tricky, especially for women. Even though Morocco has a lot of Western influence, 99% of the population is Muslim and strongly religious. Moroccan women dress conservatively and I would advise female travellers to do the same, especially when visiting historic landmarks and walking around in the Medina. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a general rule, it’s always best to respect the country’s religion and culture. You’re there to experience how they live and learn about their culture after all!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you’re a female traveler visiting Marrakech, I would recommend you pack outfits that cover your legs and shoulders. This could be a mixture of maxi skirts and dresses, flowy trousers, shawls, and short sleeve and long sleeve t-shirts. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you’re visiting closer to the summer months, focus on bringing clothes that cover you up but keep you cool! You’ll want light airy fabrics and loose-fitting clothes. And if you’re visiting closer to winter, you’ll want to cover up and keep warm anyway as the temperature does drop quite a bit!', 'Day 1: Koutoubia, The Djemaa el-Fnaa Square & The Souks', 'For the first day of this Marrakech itinerary, let’s start with the number 1 tourist attraction and one of the top things to do in Marrakech: visit Djemaa el-Fnaa Square. This will be your first stop after dropping your bags at your accommodation and checking into your room.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Djemaa el-Fnaa square is a must-do in Marrakech. It is a large square and marketplace in the city’s center. It’s the heart of Marrakech. It’s full of stalls selling everything from souvenirs to spices, and you’ll also find a lot of snake charmers and monkey handlers (which I would avoid at all costs as it’s just not ethical).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo get to the square, you’ll have to navigate yourself through the maze that is the Medina.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollow the colors, smells, noise, and flow of the traffic until you reach the iconic main square of Al Jemaa el-Fna Square.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you’ve come intending to browse something in particular, like spices, leather goods, fabrics, and cushions, there’s a good chance you’ll find it here. Just remember to haggle, as that’s part of the fun!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDo keep your eyes and ears out, though, as this spot is known for pickpocketing and gimmicks. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWalk across the square and make your way to the Koutoubia. Koutoubia Mosque is the largest mosque in Marrakech and it’s impossible to miss thanks to its towering minaret. The mosque was built in the 12th century but the minaret wasn’t added until the late 18th century. You’re not able to go inside as it’s a functioning mosque but you can admire the beautiful exterior. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt night, the square comes to life as food stalls set up shop and people congregate to eat and socialize, especially on the rooftops surrounding the square as the view you get of the city at sunset is one of the best in the city and has famously become not only one of the best things to do in Marrakech but one of the best things to do in Morocco as it’s so epic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFind yourself a seat on a rooftop — the best view is from Cafe du France or Cafe Argana. Get some drinks, and enjoy the hustle and bustle from afar until the sun goes down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven though both these cafes offer incredible views of the Square, the food isn’t as highly valued so make your way to another restaurant in the Medina for dinner.', 'Day 2: Ben Youssef Madrasa, Le Jardin Secret and a rooftop dinner', 'Start day two of your Marrakech itinerary early as this is the best time (i.e. quietest time) to explore the city and its best attractions. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI like to start my days by visiting what I’m most excited about. In this case, this was visiting Ben Yousseff Madrasa. In my eyes, this is one of the absolute best things to do in Marrakech<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is one of the largest madrasas in Morocco and was built in the 16th century. It’s ornate, grand, and absolutely stunning. The best part? It’s finally open again!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBen Yousseff Madrasa was closed off to the public for the past 3.5 years as it was undergoing renovations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI visited just days after its official re-opening, and it did not disappoint! The tiles were impeccable, and the sun created beautiful shadows across the walls. If you’re a fan of architecture and design, this is an absolute must-do in Marrakech.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike most things to do in Marrakech, visiting Ben Yousseff Madrasa shouldn’t take more than forty minutes to one hour. The best things to do in Marrakech are short visits and short distances away from each other, making it easy for travellers. This is why you can get so much done in a day here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter spending the first hour of the morning touring the Madrasa, head to the House of Photography Museum, formally called the Maison de La Photographie, which is only a 4 mins walk from the entrance of Ben Yousseff and head straight to the building rooftop to catch a stunning panoramic view of the Medina while the rest of the city is still sleeplessly awaking. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNext on the list of things to do in Marrakech: visit Le Jardin Secret (a.k.a the Secret Garden), which, let’s be honest, is not so secret. But it is beautiful and worth a stroll around. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLe Jardin Secret is open every day from 8 am to 6 pm and you can’t book online. To visit the gardens, there is an entrance fee of 80 dirhams (£7). This fee is just to visit the gardens. You can pay an extra 40 dirhams (£3) extra to gain access to the tower, which offers stunning views of the garden and the city. I recommend doing both as it’s a great way to see the city from above, and it really isn’t a difference in price that will break the bank here, let’s be real. One of the many reasons Marrakech is a popular city and one of the best places to visit in Morocco is its affordability. And never at the expense of luxury!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter ticking off two of the best things to do in Marrakech in under 2 hours, head down to Nomad or Shtattoo rooftop restaurants for some lunch.\r\nThere are plentiful restaurant rooftop bars to choose from in Marrakech, and it wouldn’t be a trip to Marakesh without having at least one meal at a rooftop restaurant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the last half of the afternoon, make your way to Bahia Palace. Bahia Palace is a 19th-century palace that was built to be the largest and most beautiful palace of its time. It’s located in the Medina and only costs around £3 to enter. The entrance fee also includes access to the Museum of Moroccan Arts, which is located within the palace grounds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you feel like you want something more experiential instead, you could take a cooking class at Souk Cousine. This is a great way to learn about Moroccan cuisine and is one of the top things to do in Marrakech (especially as you get to what you make!). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the evening, I would recommend heading to another one of the rooftop bars or restaurants for dinner and drinks with a view. After all, it wouldn’t be a trip to Marrakech or the ultimate Marrakech itinerary without making the most of the rooftop bars.', 'Day 3: YSL Musem and Jardim Majorelle, and Gueliz', 'Time to explore outside of the Medina after a day of being confined to its walls.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn day three of this Marrakech itinerary, I recommend renting a bicycle or taxiing to Jardin Majorelle. This is one of the best things to do in Marrakech, and for a good reason: it’s simply stunning!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJardin Majorelle is a botanical garden that was created by French artist, Jacques Majorelle. The garden is home to over 300 species of plants and flowers, a cactus garden, and a stunning blue villa that’s now a museum dedicated to Yves Saint Laurent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo avoid the crowds, make your way to Jardin Majorelle first thing in the morning. Jardin Majorelle is an absolute must-do in Marrakech. You can buy tickets online or in person, but to avoid queues, I’d recommend buying online as it’s become a very popular attraction in Morocco and has quickly become one of the top things to do in Marrakech.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you’re a big YSL fan or interested in fashion, the YSL museum is just next door and worth a visit too. No photos are allowed inside, but you can photograph the beautiful conceptual building from the outside. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you’re visiting later in the day when it’s busier, I would recommend getting there 2 hours before closing, so you have enough time to wander the gardens and not cut your time short at one of the best places to visit in Morocco. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake the rest of the afternoon to explore a new side of Marrakech: the neighbourhood of Gueliz, which is often referred to as the New City.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGueliz is much more modern than the Medina, with large French-style boulevards and European-style cafes and restaurants. It’s a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the city center, and it feels like you’re in a different world entirely.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWander around, do some shopping, and have dinner before returning to your hotel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you’re not interested in visiting the ‘European’ part of Marrakech, here are some other options of things to do in Marrakech for your last afternoon in the city: Have tea at La Mamounia, Admire the Koutoubia Mosque, Have a Hamman, Sit by the pool in your Riad and relax, Visit Thieman Large Cactus Farm', '', 'And there you have it! Your jam-packed 3-day itinerary for Marrakech, Morocco! I hope this has given you some inspiration for your trip, I’ve really tried to make this itinerary as easy and as diverse as possible but there is only so much you can do in three days; so if you don’t think it’s enough time, I would recommend adding an extra day or two to your trip (or why not make it into a road trip?', '2023-06-01 16:56:56', 1),

In this Europe travel guide, I will share my top tips, best routes, and advice for taking on the Tour du Mont Blanc adventure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Tour du Mont Blanc (TMB) is a grand trek that circumnavigates Mont Blanc in nine to eleven stages. It is a classic among the many GR routes and a prized objective for serious mountain hikers. The European countries of France, Italy, and Switzerland are all part of this magnificent trip. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is no shortage of breathtaking views in the high mountain ranges, but Mont Blanc is unlike any other mountain in the world. You’ll be amazed at how dramatically this snowy peak, which is the second tallest in Europe at 4,807 meters, changes as you travel from country to country and from one vantage point to the next. The landscape is tranquil in one moment, and in the next, rocky fingers reach upward through the valleys.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany options exist along this path, making it suitable for short weekend trips and longer stays. It can take anywhere from seven to ten days if you stick to the established Tour du Mont Blanc hiking trails, but I took many side trails that offered even more breathtaking panoramas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you’re having trouble figuring out when it’s best to walk this GR route and which alternate routes are worthwhile, read on. On this page, you’ll find the best advice I can give based on my personal experience.', 'The Tour du Mont Blanc is swarmed with hikers during the summer because of its popularity. Furthermore, wild camping is only permitted above 2500m. As a result, if you intend to stay out there past sunset, it is best to either make early reservations on a mountain hunt or plan very carefully where you will sleep through the night in your tent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother great tip is: only bring the essentials and the lightest gear possible. Use a backpacking checklist to ensure you have everything before setting out on your adventure and don’t even think about carrying jeans, books, or any other unnecessary item. You will thank me later!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDepending on your goals, the Tour du Mont Blanc may offer wildly different scenic experiences at its various stages. Nonetheless, I wholeheartedly endorse the following Tour du Mont Blanc itineraries:', 'Route 1: Les Houches - Contamines', 'The Tour du Mont Blanc is a difficult hiking trail that goes around Mont Blanc.  The official starting point is in Les Houches, France, and you can return there after completing the race. The fastest and most convenient way to get there is by train unless you’re driving yourself. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe set out in the direction of Contamines after reading that the ascent on this trail is less taxing on the knees than the descent. This is also my suggestion, though you are free to hike in a clockwise direction if you prefer to reach Chamonix first. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGoing on a hike is a fantastic way to take in some natural beauty and exercise your body.  However, what if you seek a greater test of your abilities? Why not try some trails that aren’t as well-traveled, or that are technically challenging, so that you can feel the thrill of success? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can find both of these paths in the Les Houches – Contamines area, with the first being a bit shorter and less spectacular than the other but still providing good exercise (and maybe some inspiration). Another option involves crossing a Nepalese suspension bridge and the Col de Tricot mountain ridge, both of which offer breathtaking vistas and exciting experiences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe, of course, followed the unofficial route up to Col de Tricot, which begins at the Bellevue mountain station and winds its way through the woods and up to the summit. To put your mind at ease, we walked the 11 hours to Contamines rather than taking the cable car from Bellevue mountain station. Because of the constant uphill and downhill movement, as well as the weight of our camping gear, this was quite a challenge for our knees.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />If you want to get the most out of your trip here without enduring as much discomfort, I recommend carrying only a daypack and staying in huts or hotels. If you find that an adventurous spirit complements your own, know that after two or three days of hiking, things will start to settle down.', 'Route 2: Contamines - Refuges des Mottets', 'When you arrive in Contamines, you can choose from a variety of hotels and other lodgings. If you brought your tent and sleeping bags, there’s a designated campsite for you to use. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom Contamines, hikers can reach Refuges des Mottets at an elevation of 1,870 meters by either following the official TMB trail or taking the alternative route, both of which offer unique challenges and rewards. Even though the official TMB route is a good option in the event of bad weather or if you’d rather take the bus, we opted for the alternative trail because it crosses several mountain ridges. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nExpect a beautiful ridge walk from Mont Joly to the Aiguille Croche if you take the alternate route. With a picture-perfect panorama of Mont Blanc and the Rochers des Fiz, this path easily takes first place on the list of most stunning hikes in Europe. If you want to avoid the crowds and visit when the trail is snow-free (around the middle of July), then September is your best bet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s up to you if you want to keep going to Refuges des Mottets or stay the night at Refuge de Nant Borrant. We hiked for approximately 12 hours from Contamines to Refuge de Nant Borrant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe average time is 8 hours, but we were slower than average because of our heavy packs. You can probably guess that by the time we reached Refuge de Nant Borrant, we were in no shape to continue our journey.  We were fortunate enough to find a free campsite only a short distance (about 6 minutes) from the Refuge, where we could set up our tent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe following morning, our trip to Refuges des Mottets began. Given the limited availability of alternate routes, you may experience significant delays along this stretch of the TMB. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing, given the incredible variety found in nature.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Refuges des Mottets is the very last place you’ll visit in France before entering Italy through the border.', 'Route 3: Refuges des Mottets - Champex-Lac', 'Crossing the Italian border at the Col de la Seigne causes a sudden and dramatic shift in the surrounding landscape. The Arête du Brouillard, the massive south ridge of Mont Blanc, is surrounded by an unprecedented number of jagged glaciers, white summits, and graceful granite mountains, making the Val Veny and Val Ferret the most beautiful side of the Mont Blanc massif. This is true even though the French side of the mountain is stunning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn your way to Champex-Lac, you’ll stop by the charming Italian village of Courmayeur for a bite to eat. As we did, you might want to look for a hotel with spa services if you’re traveling with a large party. Since Courmayeur is only set up for winter visitors, we were able to book a 5-star hotel complete with a sauna, pool, and hammam for only $60 per night.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing that, you should definitely check out Rifugio Walter Bonatti (2025m), which was named after the legendary Italian mountaineer Walter Bonatti. On a clear day, the view of Mont Blanc from this hut is so breathtaking that a lot of visitors choose to spend the night there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to get from Italy to Switzerland, you’ll have to take a trip over Grand Col Ferret en route to Champex-lac. If you are determined to hike a different route, you can switch it up in Praz-de-Fort by switching to the Arpette route. But keep in mind that both going up and coming down is hard and shouldn’t be done if it’s raining.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to the high altitude, any precipitation will likely fall as snow or ice, making the trail unfit for hikers.', 'Route 4: Champex-Lac - Les Houches', 'Champex-Lac is a quaint community that offers great food and recreation opportunities, from a fantastic bakery to a campground.  The only problem is that you still haven’t left Switzerland, so in order to get to France, you’ll have to climb yet another mountain. If you make it over to the Col de Balme, this is how you might find the Mont Blanc looking once more. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe TMB’s final is phenomenal. Up until the second-to-last step in Les Houches, the heart of the Mont Blanc region is visible. The walk and the scenery along it are both excellent. For the reason that it travels through the Aiguilles Rouges Reserve Naturelle, one of the most beautiful protected areas in all of France. Depending on the path you take, you may or may not go through Chamonix.', '2023-06-01 19:11:40', 1),

(14, 25, 'Things you should know before you solo travel in India | India', 'Asia', 'Solo Travel', 'For many, the prospect of travelling around India alone is daunting. Solo travel in India can seem even more so because there’s no one to share the responsibility with. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA lot of bad news comes out of India as a country and it would be silly to say there’s nothing to worry about. It’s completely normal to feel a little apprehensive when planning a trip to India. It’s important to remember though that India is also an incredible country with so much to offer…<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon’t let the fear stop you, let it motivate you to do your research, plan well and make informed decisions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the Himalayas to untouched beaches, ancient architecture to places of worship for countless religions, dense jungles to desert landscapes; India has it all. It’s also home to some of the most friendly and welcoming people I have ever met. ', 'The bottom line is to be careful, but open, when traveling solo in India. Travelling solo can open up so many opportunities if you keep your wits about you. You meet more people, have a liberating amount of independence, and can be spontaneous more easily. Be savvy, and chances are you will be fine. But it’s important to be prepared and to feel confident going into your big adventure in India!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere is everything you need to know about traveling solo in India:\r\n\r\n', '1. Do Your Research', 'Before you start booking anything, research the culture and read the news from India. Get educated on what and where exactly the risks are, how you should behave to be respectful, and what the tensions are in the country. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOkay, it’s a lot to look into, but I promise it will be worth it to properly understand the country. It will help you know how to act and delve deeper into your journey.', '2. Ease yourself in', 'The first step upon reaching India will be the taxi journey from the airport to your first accommodation. Get in touch with your accommodation and ask for them to arrange a taxi. That way you can be sure the driver will be trustworthy. There are plenty of taxi scams, especially in Delhi.   <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, consider joining a group for the first week or so. I started my time in India on a yoga teaching course with a group of people. I think this was the perfect way to ease me into being in the country as I was always with others as I got settled.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhether you arrange to start off in a group or not, it’s a good idea to start your travels in one of the easier locations. Try Rishikesh, the home of yoga, or one of the beaches of Goa. These places are much more used to tourists and have a lot of western influence.', '3. You won’t ever actually be alone', 'Stay in hostels wherever you go and you will constantly be meeting new people. Hostels are full of like-minded travelers to share experiences or explore with. Some even have communal meals and go out of their way to set up group trips. Most people are on the same route, so chances are you will be able to travel on with someone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, India has a population of over 1 billion. You will constantly be surrounded by people and locals are more often than not very friendly and welcoming. Expect to have strangers start conversations with you all the time. You may even be invited to someone’s home. And, yes, accept those invitations, just make sure to evaluate the situation first.', '4. You will get stared at and asked for photos', 'One of the toughest aspects of travelling India is the lack of privacy. The friendliness of the locals and crowds of people can get annoying if you want some time to yourself. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is guaranteed that you will be stared at unashamedly by people of all ages and genders. There is nothing you can do to stop this, and it will happen whether you are alone or in a group. It can feel extremely uncomfortable but understand that for some, you will be the first foreigner they have ever seen. I found it was best to just ignore them. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother common occurrence will be photos. You will be approached constantly for a selfie. Often, you will say yes, and the next thing you know a massive group will each want an individual photo. As a woman, I worried what some of the men were doing with the photos, so early on I decided to say no to most photos unless taken by a woman or a family. Plus, I started requiring group photos rather than individual ones. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGirls, if you are on a beach in a bikini, it’s a different matter. The most popular beaches for tourists (Goa, Gokarna, and Varkala) are fine for wearing western swimwear. However, you should cover up on the popular beaches during the weekends or public holidays and on the more isolated beaches as Indian tourists who are not used to seeing barely clothed people are more likely to visit them at this time. If you don’t, expect photos without your consent and lots of staring.', '2023-06-07 19:01:18', 1),

It’s only 2 euros, and much cheaper than taking a taxi!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn case you’re living in Europe, or you want to visit Porto as part of a Portugal road trip, you can also drive there.

Take a free walking tour', 'Whenever I’m in a new city, I love joining a walking tour. It’s the best way to explore the place on foot, get the best insights from locals, and learn about the city‘s history. And you simply come across hidden corners that would never find yourself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn case you don’t know the concept of a free walking tour, here’s how it works: You can book a spot for free, take the tour and afterward pay the amount you think the tour was worth. So, it’s not really free, but you have more control over what you can afford to pay! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Porto, there are several tour operators offering free walking tours. So check out the reviews and select the one you like the most so that you can enjoy one of the best budget-friendly things to do in Porto!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of the main attractions you´ll likely visit during the tour include:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRibeira District: Located along the banks of the Douro River, Ribeira is Porto´s historic heart. Its narrow cobbled streets, colorful houses, and charming cafes create a picturesque atmosphere.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDom Luís I Bridge: This iconic double-deck iron bridge spans the Douro River and offers stunning views of Porto. You can cross the massive bridge on foot, by taking the tram, and even by car. Although it may be quite a challenge if you’re scared of heights, the view from the top is so worth it! From up there you can watch the river flowing into the sea, Porto’s hilly neighborhoods, and the other bridges outside of town.<br />\r\nFun fact: Did you know that the bridge has a famous relative? When you look at it, you may realize similarities to another massive metal monument. Yep, the Eiffel Tower in Paris! Ponte Dom Luís I is actually the result of one of Eiffel’s students’ designs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPorto Cathedral (Sé do Porto): Dating back to the 12th century, the Porto Cathedral is an impressive Romanesque monument with Gothic and Baroque elements. Explore its beautiful cloisters and enjoy panoramic views from its terrace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLivraria Lello: Book lovers will appreciate a visit to Livraria Lello, one of the world´s most beautiful bookstores. Its stunning neo-Gothic architecture and intricate wooden bookshelves are a sight to behold.', '2. Visit Jardins do Palácio de Cristal (Crystal Palace Gardens)', 'Escape the hustle and bustle of the city by visiting the Jardins do Palácio de Cristal, a serene green space with stunning views over the Douro River. This park offers various activities and attractions, making it an ideal spot for budget-friendly trips.', '3. Visit the Douro Valley', 'A visit to Porto wouldn´t be complete without experiencing the breathtaking Douro River, where the grapes of the famous Port wine grow. It’s an extremely picturesque landscape, as the river Duoro waves right through the valley. <br />\r\nWhile some river cruises can be expensive, there are budget-friendly options available. You can also rent a car, but there are so many viewpoints that you can visit for free that offer spectacular views across the wine grapes, the river, and some of the wineries, that make it worthy. So don’t miss it!', '4. Port Wine Cellar Tour and Tasting', 'What’s the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of Porto? Probably Port wine! So what would be a trip to Porto without Port wine?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat’s why many port wine producers offer wine tastings and cellar tours. And they aren’t even expensive. For only 15 Euros, you can join a port wine cellar tour followed by a small tasting of three wines. This is one of the best things to do in Porto on a budget!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven better if you’re traveling on a shoestring and you’re looking for free things to do in Porto, a few cellars offer tours and tastings for free. Just walk along the riverfront in Vila Nova de Gaia and choose the free tour that sounds the best to you.', '2023-06-08 16:51:37', 1),
(16, 29, 'The Ultimate Belize Travel Guide | Belize', 'North America', 'Active', 'There are half a dozen things in the jungle that worry me: skinny green vine snakes, 200-pound panthers, and all kinds of poisonous plants. And yet I´m walking through the dense jungle in a bathing suit, with an inflatable tube hanging from my shoulder as if I´ve not a care in the world. Therein lies the beauty of Belize—the country is an odd mixture of foreign and familiar, a living contradiction in the most fascinating ways. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt sits in the middle of Central America, flanked by Mexico and Guatemala, but has more in common with Caribbean culture than its immediate neighbors. The country welcomes foreigners as an integral part of its economy (and takes the American dollar), yet it has managed to resist some of the biggest trappings of that international influence. For example, there are no American chain restaurants. Kentucky Fried Chicken tried to open some locations here in the eighties, but it didn´t stick; locals were curious but ultimately more satisfied with the mom-and-pop shops that operate in backyard kitchens and the women who sell snacks out of coolers on the side of the road.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis Central American destination is the adventure traveler´s dream, from its jungle-covered peaks to a coastline dotted with more than 450 islands stretching across the world´s second-largest barrier reef. It´s also delightfully accessible, culturally diverse, and home to historically significant Maya sites, creating a particular dynamism that´s unique to the region. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI recently spent seven days trying to crack the mystery that is Belize. I followed Maya guides into caves and over towering ruins. I snorkeled with third-generation professional watermen and hiked through jungles looking for monkeys and wild cats. I ate a steady diet of stewed chicken with rice and beans in the mountains and seafood prepared every way possible on the coast. I couldn´t get enough of local delicacies, like banana jam and Marie Sharp´s pepper sauce, both of which changed my life in small yet not insignificant ways. I fully admit that a week was not enough. Even though I was constantly moving, always seeking the next adventure, I barely scratched the surface. Belize remains a mystery. A delightful mystery. And I can´t wait to go back.<br />\r\n', 'Hire a guide. I enjoy the discovery that trekking alone in the wilderness provides, but you should consider hiring guides for most of your pursuits in Belize. First, adventure guiding is a growing business here. Second, every guide that accompanied me grew up in the country and has a passion for their backyard and its resources. But mostly, you won´t know what you´re looking at without a guide. For instance, I toured Caracol, an impressive site of Maya ruins, with a guide and learned about how the city supported evidence of a middle class in the civilization and also that they believed the saba tree could span heaven, earth, and the underworld. In fact, some Maya sites, like the ATM cave (see below) require accompaniment by local guides to help preserve the sanctity of the area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGetting around is slow going. It´s a small country, but it takes a long time to drive from one side to the other because there are only four paved highways. Belize is divided into six different districts, though most travelers stick to the mountains in the west, the coastal towns to the south, and the cayes that punctuate the sea. Aside from the highways, the rest of the roads are dirt, which requires four-wheel drive and can become impassable after a hard rain. Land travel between districts and towns is so tough that many travelers and locals take puddle jumpers between the bustling towns of Belize City, San Ignacio, Placencia, and the Cayes. Keep this in mind if you´re planning to drive over to the next town or park—20 miles could take an hour or two.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrepare for the jungle. If you´re going to spend time in the interior, you´ll be in a subtropical ecosystem that has all the hallmarks of a jungle: heat, humidity, and bugs. Lightweight hiking pants and long-sleeved sun shirts will be your best friends when it comes to keeping the bugs off. A layer of deet helps, too. Take a few precautions and you´ll be just fine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEmbrace soft adventure. The mountains and jungles are ripe for serious adventure, and dedicated residents are hard at work developing mountain-bike trail systems and rock-climbing routes. The potential for canyoneering in the Maya Mountains is off the charts as well. But by and large, guided adventures are of the soft variety, and most companies and resorts will steer you toward zip-line tours and cave-tubing opportunities. But don´t fret; the guides are locals who know the jungles well and are often willing to customize an adventure for a client. If there´s a river you want to explore, or a multiday excursion you´re dying to experience, ask your guide what´s possible. They´ll probably accommodate you.', 'Belize Travel: Where to Go', 'It´s a small country, so you might be inclined to try and “see it all.” Don´t. If you only have a few days, pick one region. If you´re there for a week, consider splitting your time evenly between the islands and the mountains.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are four regions: northern Belize, western Belize, southern Belize, and the Cayes. Central, coastal Belize City offers quick access to the cayes via puddle jumpers and ferries. It´s also the starting point for the only paved highways headed north, west, and south. Western Belize is mountainous, full of waterfalls, Maya archeological sites, caves, and jungle resorts. Off the coast, the 450 cayes are a mix of privately owned, bustling centers of tourism and pristine preserves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe reef acts as a sort of glue, linking all these islands and attracting snorkelers, divers, and anglers. Southern Belize is home to coastal towns with a vibrant Garifuna culture, like the scrappy port town Dangriga, and up-and-coming tourist towns, like Hopkins Village and Placencia. Inland you´ll find wild rainforests that hide animal preserves and archaeological sites. Northern Belize is the country´s hub of agriculture. Sugarcane is the main crop, but you´ll also find groves of bananas and pineapples.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe´re focusing on the hot spots of adventure—western Belize, southern Belize, and the cayes. Follow this guide to explore Maya sites, trek through jungles and caves, and island-hop along the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, paddling, diving, and fishing as you go.<br />\r\n', 'Western Belize', 'The 72-mile Western Highway runs from Belize City to the town of San Ignacio, a bustling hub with a lively food and bar scene roughly 11 miles from the Guatemalan border. As you make this drive west, the terrain quickly goes from floodplain (Belize City sits below sea level and was evacuated in the 1960s after a hurricane) to scrub brush to lush tropical forest. The mountains in western Belize rise to 3,681 feet, serving as a backdrop to communities like San Ignacio and Belmopan. From San Ignacio, the pavement mostly ends and the mountain roads that define western Belize can only be tackled by a four-wheel drive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe terrain is decidedly jungly, with lush broad-leaved forest dominating most of the slopes and limestone crags giving way to hundreds of caves. Rivers run wild, offering numerous waterfalls and swimming holes. Citrus trees are everywhere, and Belizeans like to pull the fruit from the tree before it´s ripe, slice it, and eat it with salt, pepper, lime, and Marie Sharp´s pepper sauce. Mountain biking and rock climbing are gaining popularity, and more routes are being built every year. But if you´re in the Maya Mountains, you want to spend your time trekking to waterfalls, exploring caves, and visiting Maya ruins.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of these adventures can be done on your own, but again, splurge for a tour guide so you can fully comprehend the magnitude of what you´re seeing. Even if you´re not camping and you´re only exploring for a day, bring everything you need with you—snacks, extra layers, extra water. And try not to be the last car out of the parking lot; the roads in the mountains are remote and rough, so if you break down, you want there to be one more car coming behind you to help. Otherwise, you´ll be spending the night.', 'Southern Belize', 'This region is a tangle of lively coastal towns and beach bars, thriving wildlife preserves, pristine beaches, lesser-traveled Maya sites, and active Garifuna culture. For the most part, it’s not as busy as western Belize and there are still vast tracts of jungle and forest that tourists and even most locals visit, particularly in the southernmost tip of the country.', 'The Cayes', 'Belize is absolutely lousy with islands. These act as exclamation points along the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, the second-largest reef system in the world and one of the healthiest of its size. Yes, the Great Blue Hole is here—a seemingly bottomless pit that you can dive into, paddle around, or fly over during a scenic tour—but there is so much more to this area than diving into a hole.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSandy beaches are rare here, but they do exist if you know where to look. The ironically named “Secret Beach” on Ambergris Caye is the most popular, boasting restaurants and thatch-roofed picnic tables jutting out of the water. There´s world-class snorkeling and diving everywhere, some of the most productive saltwater fly-fishing in the world, and paddling options that range from easy two-hour spins to multiday bucket-list adventures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLocal airlines Maya Air and Tropic Air operate regular puddle jumpers making trips from the mainland to Ambergris Caye and Caye Caulker, the two busiest Cayes off the coast. There are also regular ferries that connect the major islands, and you can hire boats and guides to take you to smaller, more remote islands along the reef.<br />\r\n', '2023-06-08 17:24:48', 1),

You’ll be in the middle of trendy restaurants and shops and can walk or take the metro to most sights. However, most accommodations won’t go below €80 a night, so it might be worth searching in other areas nearby too.<br />\r\nAlternatively, find a hotel in Montmartre just outside the city center but full of character and charming streets and cheaper accommodation in general.

It also went through a famous period of cabarets, brothels, and underground nightlife, known mainly for the Moulin Rouge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese days, it keeps its beautiful village atmosphere and is a great place to stay when you visit Paris.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Basilica Sacre-Coeur is the icon of Montmartre, a stunning white church that sits on the very top of the hill looking over Paris. Climb up the steep cobbled streets and zig-zagged blocks of stairs to reach the gardens below the church, where you’ll be met with views of the impressive three-domed church, which looks more like a palace!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can access the central dome by climbing 300 steps to the top, where you’ll find even greater panoramic views of Paris.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRue de l’Abreuvoir is known as ‘the prettiest street in Paris’, located on the charming hills of Montmartre. You could easily spend a morning walking around the area, getting lost down the streets, and taking photos of the beautiful houses and doorways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, visiting Rue de l‘Abreuvoir is an absolute must on your trip to Paris! This street is also one of the oldest, first mentioned in 1325, and home to ancient houses which date back to the 1930s. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most famous house on Rue de l’Abreuvoir is ‘La Maison Rose’ (the pink house). This gorgeous pink house, with green shutters, and a blanket of ivy behind it, is a famous cafe that used to be visited by many renowned writers, poets, and artists. Picasso even used to hang out at this very spot!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWander down the hill towards the Pigalle neighborhood, where you’ll find lots of picturesque spots and, of course, the world-famous Moulin Rouge. Montmartre was once known for its many windmills sat on the hill here, one of which was home to the Moulin Rouge (Red Windmill) during the neighborhood’s time of underground nightlife and debauchery.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was a famous time between the two world wars when people from all walks of life would gather to watch dancing, singing, and acrobatics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese days you can still watch the Moulin Rouge show here, but you’ll need to book months in advance as it’s one of the most popular things to do in Paris.  ', 'Day 3: Notre Dame, Louvre and more', 'Get up and prepare yourself for a busy day of sightseeing on your trip to Paris! Day 3 is all about soaking up the unique Parisian culture, whether art, literature, or music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVisit the Notre Dame Cathedral as early as possible to really observe the beauty without the crowds. If you can arrive before 8 AM, the sun is still behind the cathedral, and the square in front is almost empty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis breathtaking religious building is another icon of Paris and a must-see on your Paris trip, mainly because it’s one of the oldest Gothic cathedrals in the world (built between 1163 and 1245)! Admire the fascinating gargoyles, and the gothic features, and climb the 422 steps to the top of the cathedral tower for magical views over the center of Paris.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote: Since the 2019 fire that consumed Notre Dame Cathedral, the majority of the cathedral is still closed for repairs. You can, however, still visit the cathedral square and look onto Notre Dame (be aware there is a lot of scaffolding covering the facade), and you can visit the crypt.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s still worth wandering around the parameters of Notre Dame, if not just to be close to this incredible icon of history in Paris. Hidden in a side street nearby is a beautiful little cafe called Au Vieux Paris d’Arcole. Stop here for a photo and a morning coffee before continuing your day. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nShakespeare and Company Bookstore might not look like much from the outside, but enter, and you’ll find a world of hidden treasures! Books are piled up from floor to ceiling, and great literature covers almost every surface. If you’re a book lover, this is a must-do on your trip to Paris. You can even enjoy a coffee and a cake here while you peruse the pages of ancient novels!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Louvre Museum is one of the most famous in the entire world! It’s known for housing the Mona Lisa and its unique triangular shape. Watch people of all ages outside trying to get the typical ‘Louvre’ photo and positioning the triangle in their hands (think Leaning Tower of Pisa style!). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom Shakespeare and Company Bookstore, you can reach the Louvre within 15 minutes walking. Because of the museum’s popularity, buying tickets online in advance is recommended. If you don’t feel like going into the museum, you can relax or take photos at the square or nearby park.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlternatively, start your walk through the oldest park in Paris: Jardin des Tuileries (Tuileries Garden). It extends from the Louvre all the way to Place de la Concorde. The Jardin Tuileries is a large public park with fountains, chairs, and grass to relax. Throughout the garden, you will find various art like statues and a smaller version of the Arc de Triomphe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the Louvre, hop on the metro towards Gare de Lyon. From here, it’s a 5-minute walk to Rue Cremieux, one of the most fantastic, colorful streets in Paris! This sweet cobbled street is bordered by rainbow-colored Parisian houses, flowers, and bikes and is a lovely place to grab some photos on your trip to Paris. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpend the rest of your day in the trendy neighborhood: Le Marais. You can find everything you could possibly need in this beautiful little medieval neighborhood, whether it’s trendy vintage shops and restaurants, luxurious squares, or ancient, narrow medieval streets that could be straight from a novel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn your walk, take a look inside the concept stores ‘Merci’ and ‘Papier Tigre’, or get a delicious dinner at restaurants like ‘Ober Mamma’ (Italian) or ‘PNY’ (burgers).', '', '', '2023-06-10 12:48:08', 1),

Board the train and experience breathtaking views of lush green tea plantations, mountains, viaducts, valleys, and dense jungle. As the journey goes on, you move higher and higher up into the rolling green highlands where the big tea farms are and many beautiful hilltop villages and waterfalls. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe old-fashioned train is famous for its open windows and doors, which have become a buzz for people who want to feel the wind through their hair as they travel. In fact, it’s become one of the most famous things to do in Sri Lanka, with travelers coming from all over the world to experience it. What’s more, it’s the perfect way to experience Sri Lankan life. Meet smiling locals on the train, wave to the running children along the tracks, and eat the spicy snacks sold by vendors who board at each stop. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe train was brought to life in the mid-1800s when Sri Lanka was under British colonial rule. During this time, it was used as a train to transport tea from the plantations to Colombo, where it would then be exported internationally. These days, it’s used mainly by locals who use it to travel between home and work. Because of this, getting a ticket as a tourist can be a little more difficult, as seats sell out fast. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a must-do experience in Sri Lanka.

Make some stops along the way', 'If you have the time, make some stops along the way. The train stops at beautiful hilltop towns like Nuwara Eliya and Haputale, where you can jump off and explore the famous tea plantations. For example, the Lipton tea plantation is home to some beautiful viewpoints. Remember, the highlands are perfect for growing tea because of their cooler, wetter climate, so remember to bring layers and waterproofs!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can get off at numerous locations throughout the trip. For example, Nuwara Eliya, Happuta, or Ella. Some of the top things to do are:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. Visit the beautiful botanical gardens in Kandy.<br />\r\n2. Walk over the 30-meter-high Nine Arch Bridge in Ella.<br />\r\n3. See the impressive tea fields of Nuwara Eliya.', '3. Pick the best side of the train', 'If you want to get the best photos of the view, it’s essential to be on the best side of the train. The right-hand side of the train is the best place until Nuwara Eliya. From here, jump over to the left side if you can for the rest of the trip. This ensures you get wide-open views on both parts of the journey.', '4. Bring food with you', 'The train itself doesn’t have anywhere you can buy food. However, the best thing about the Kandy to Ella train ride is the local vendors who jump on at each station to sell their goods. You’ll hear them shouting and singing their prices as they walk between the cabins with steaming baskets off spicy fried snacks, salty peanuts, or fresh fruit. Make sure to have a little bit of cash on you so that you can indulge. ', '2023-06-10 13:05:45', 1),

It’s great value for money and serves a very tasty breakfast! It’s approximately a 40-minute walk from the city center and 10 minutes by a cheap taxi ride. Regular buses also run to and from town. It’s very peaceful, has a big garden, and great vibes where you’ll meet other like-minded travelers. The host Lana is very loving and has lots of useful information. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlternatively, if you’re solo traveling in Montenegro and prefer to stay nearer the centre, other hostels are available at approximately £13 per night, or a 3-star hotel costs around 30- 50 euros.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI decided to travel North to Zabjlak. I took a bus from Podgorica for €9 to stay in a beautiful handmade wooden log cabin. Think Goldilocks and the 3 bears, this place is magical! ETNO Houses USKOCI is authentic and looks out to the stunning Durmitor National Park. I went there for tranquility and to be at one with nature. It’s situated on a working farm and provides electricity and water. It’s up to you to keep the wood burner running to get cozy after star gazing with a hot chocolate and blanket on the balcony.

Here I watched the sunset over the city, played table tennis with the very friendly locals (bring bats or use the locals) and went to the “free outdoor muscle gym”. There are also loads of green spaces throughout the city to meet locals and use the outdoor gyms for free! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother of the best things to do in Podgorica is a free walking tour of the city!

Experience fun and adventure whilst “soaking” in Montenegro’s stunning wild scenery. This is a great way to meet other people if you’re solo traveling in Montenegro! It costs on average €45 per day,  including 2 meals. Recommended companies are the Waterfall Rafting Centre and Etno Houses Uskoci (which includes transport). 1-3 day packages are also available. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou should also drink from the Tara River!

The road is not paved, it is intermittently maintained and the weather can seriously affect the conditions of the pass.

This meant getting out of the car to inspect the road, reversing (on a very steep incline) and trying a different section of road.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe clearance was also a challenge. We scraped the bottom of the car on large boulders several times, snapping off a piece of the undercarriage. A larger 4×4 with higher clearance would have made it easier.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nComing down was easier in that we didn’t get stuck; but it was a bit harder on the nerves. Those vertical edges seemed much closer as the car tried to get a grip on the steep gravel track. Our 4×4 had a low range downhill lock which limits the speed and applies break automatically, which was very useful once you got the hang of it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll in all, Sani Pass a nerve-testing ascent and descent, which needed to be treated with respect.', 'HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO DRIVE THE SANI PASS?', 'It took us 1 hour and 15 minutes to complete the 9-kilometer Sani Pass (one way) excluding stops to get unstuck and rebuild our nerves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut the time it takes depends greatly on the conditions you encounter and the type of car you have.

Your accommodation will also be able to organize a guided tour of a village.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEXPLORE THE ESCARPMENT<br />\r\nThe views from any point along the Lesotho escarpment are excellent. But for something even more special, hike to Hodgson’s Peak South. It’s 2 hours each way across the grassy plateau of Lesotho. You’ll meet Basotho goat and sheepherders and be rewarded with stunning views.
